üôÑ Book Quote Collector 

Tired of just reading quotes? Now you can collect them too! Behold, the pinnacle of literary achievement: an app that lets you save snippets of text so you can forget the rest of the book. Revolutionary. 
ü§î What Does This App Do? 

Absolutely nothing groundbreaking, but hey, it does it with style! 

    Saves Quotes: Finally, a place for all those profound thoughts you copy-paste from Goodreads. "To be or not to be" has found its new home.
    Searches Quotes: Can't remember if you saved that one Nietzsche quote? Just type "God is Dead" and hope for the best.
    Filters Quotes: Organize your collection of out-of-context wisdom by... category. Because clearly, "Philosophy" and "Sarcastic READMEs" need better sorting.
    Favorites Quotes: Star your top picks so you can show everyone your incredible depth. "I have 37 favorited quotes, therefore I am cultured."
    Dark Mode: Saves your phone's battery by displaying less light. Groundbreaking innovation. Also respects your system preference, because we care so much.
    Looks Modern: Uses the latest in Material Design principles. It's basically the iPhone of quote apps. (Disclaimer: Not actually related to Apple or iPhones).
     

üì∏ Boring Screenshots 

(Actual screenshots of your app go here.)
(Caption: "My quotes. My precious.")
(Caption: "Finally found that one quote... that I saved 3 years ago.") 
üèóÔ∏è Architecture (Because We Use Big Words) 

    MVVM: Model-View-ViewModel. Sounds smart, ensures the code isn't a complete mess.
    Room: For when you want your quotes to stay longer than your New Year's resolutions.
    LiveData & ViewModel: Makes the UI update magically (or so we hope). It's like magic, but with more boilerplate code.
    Java: Old school! Who needs Kotlin's conciseness when you can have verbose, slightly outdated code?
     

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (If You Dare) 

    Clone this repo. (You probably already did if you're reading this).
    Open in Android Studio. (Pray it syncs without Gradle throwing a tantrum).
    Hit Run. (Watch the emulator slowly boot up, questioning your life choices).
    Collect quotes. (Finally, validation for your literary taste).
